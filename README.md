# Home manager
Home manager is a system to keep track of user's house inventory. Basically it is a small warehousing system. It is 
mainly focused on groceries and other supplies that need to be purchased on regular basis based on their expiration 
or consumption. The supplies need to be purchased, stored, used and sometimes removed. Also the supplies are often 
shared among the whole household and not only used by single user. The system should allow parallel operations over 
the multiple households as well as in the single household. The user interface should be completely web based with 
optimization for desktop and mobile device. The first prototype should support just two areas of control over the 
supplies:
* purchase - it should be possible to list multiple items that need to purchased and in what amounts.
* storage - it should be possible to manage items that exist in the system  and in what amounts.
	
## Glossary
* __User__ - any subject that authenticates to the system and is able to call it's functions. In the first prototype 
version there will be only two user roles - user and admin. User can do anything in the system with exception 
of managing other users, this functionality should be handled by admin role only.
* __Household__ - a group of users that share the common assets in the system. Each user can be part of multiple 
households, each household can have multiple users. In the first prototype version, each user can fully manage 
the households he is assigned to. Household can be created by any user.
* __Item__ - generic item in the system. The items have name, expiration date, base unit of measure and category.
* __Category__ - items can be grouped into categories, each item can have at most one category.
* __Storage__ - when items exist in the system, it is useful to know where they are and in future what conditions this
storage provides that can have impact on item's durability - like difference in temperature between fridge and a pantry. 
* __Shopping list__ - when going shopping it is useful (if not even necessary) to prepare a list of items 
to be purchased. It is worth to keep a history of shopping lists but only in an archived form.

## User roles
As was mentioned earlier, there are no rights or roles defined for the prototype all users have similar capabilities 
in the system, the following description of two users serves for more meaningful description of user stories and 
for possible future extension of the access control system.
* __Adam__ - _User A_ - Typical user of the system. an living in an appartment who wants to have control over 
the household inventory.
* __Beata__ - _User B_ - Another typical user of the system. Adam's wife who also wants to have control over 
the common household.
* __Pooka__ - _Admin_ - Administrator of the system.
	
## User stories
User stories are stored as [issues with label user-story](https://github.com/pnidl/home-manager/labels/user-story).

## Quality Attributes (Non-functional requirements)
* __Security__
    * users must be able to access their household data only
    * user data are separated on per-household basis (DB schema based separation is sufficient)
	* OAuth2 authorization framework should be used for user authentication
	* HTTPS should be used
* __Performance__
	* the system should keep the response times for each API call under 2 seconds (TODO: review this)
	* the system should minimize amount API requests - ewbsockets or messaging for UI should be used instead 
	of infinite data refresh loop
* __Stability__
	* the system should not be restarted because of unplanned outages more than once per month
* __Reliability__
	* for the prototype phase no HA is requested 
* __Capacity__
	* each household should be able to keep history of one year of using the system (TODO: analyze the data demands 
	after prototype implementation and testing)
* __Documentation__
	* each component of the system must be specified before implementation
	* the component specification turns into documentation during implemetation
	* the component specifications are part of this Software Guidebook 
	* the Software Guidebook is updated whenever business or technical requirements change
	* user manual is not requested for the prototype
* __Portability__
	* the system must be able to run on Linux and Windows
	* the system must not be dependent on any specific hosting solution
* __Quality__
	* each component in the system has to have reasonable amount of unit tests (TODO: study something about reasonable 
	code coverage)
	* each component in the system has to have an integration test
* __Internationalization__
	* the prototype must provide English and Czech languages only but with possibility to add other languages seamlessly
	* the system must provide a possibility to translate dynamic as well as static texts
* __Backup__
	* there is no backup requested for the prototype
* __Extensibility__
	* the prototype should provide a platform for future extensions like connectivity to some super market APIs, 
	supplies prices, etc.
	
## Principles
* __Spring__ - As there is currently no better IoC framework available and I'm really proficient with Spring already.
* __OSGi__ - It's not really necessary for this application but this project should serve also as a playground for
prototyping and testing interesting technologies. In this context, I would like to try microservice oriented and
event driven architecture based on OSGi.
* __Angular2__ - It's hot, it's single-page approach, it uses TypeScript on top of that dumb JavaScript 
* __Decomposition__ - For the prototype the application is decomposed to frontend and backend part only. Internal 
decomposition is described in [Components chapter](#components) but in reality the whole backend is just a single
monolithic application. However decomposition in later stages should be prepared as effortless as possible.
* __Single model codebase__ - In previous projects it was almost always necessary to create multiple levels of model
classes - DBOs, DTOs and VOs, let's try something old - benefit from JPA entities and easy JSON serialization. It may
also be beneficial for later testing of NoSQL databases.
* __Automated testing__ - For each compacted unit of code (basically public methods) there should be a unit test,
at least one integration test should be present to prove that the application is able start. UI and REST API testing
is not part of scope of the prototype but should be added as soon as the prototype is functional.

## Context
There really is not much to say about the context of the simple system as Home manager is in a prototype phase. 
There is a system and it has it's users and admin. The admin uses UI, REST API and direct SSH access to server
to monitor and manage the whole system. Users access the UI to manage and view their household(s).
![Context diagram](./documentation/diagrams/img/HomeManagerContext.png)

## Containers
__TODO__: add event sourcing technologies - Kafka + MongoDB
The prototype version of Home Manager uses pretty straightforward three tier architecture. All data are:
* stored in the PostgreSQL database
* retrieved, processed and provided via REST API by Karaf based Backend server and
* displayed by Angular2 based single-page UI application.

![Containers diagram](./documentation/diagrams/img/HomeManagerContainers.png)

## Components
__TODO__: rework for NoSQL and event based approach (get rid of the ugly diagram)
High level components of the system are feature oriented. For the prototype, almost all features are entity based. 

![Containers diagram](./documentation/diagrams/img/HomeManagerComponents.png)

### Frontend
UI part of the system should be implemented as an [Angular2](http://www.angular2.com/) single-page app. It is composed
of multiple screens (components, pages, whatever) and communicates with the backend via REST API. Following diagram
describes the detailed flow inside of the application:

![Web flow diagram](./documentation/diagrams/img/WebFlow.png)

#### Default page
Default page will be shown to unauthenticated users. It will allow users to login and/or register new account. 
It will communicate with [User service](#user-service) to provide following features:
* User registration (#3)
* User login (#4)
* Password reset (#10)

__URL path__ - /

![Default page mockup](./documentation/mockups/img/DefaultPage.png)

#### Top menu component
All pages except the default page will display a top menu. It will show:
* Home manager logo
* drop-down menu language selection - the default language to be set shoudl be retrieved from browser information (#11)
if this information is missing all the language is not implemented English will be chosen. When the language is changed 
by the user it is persisted to his account (#12) and the page should refresh with changed localization.
* drop-down menu with:
    * user's email address - it doesn't provide any action
    * account settings button (#10) - clicking it will take user to [Account settings page](#account-settings-page) 
    * logout button - clicking it will invalidate current authentication token and take user to 
    [Default page](#default-page)
* drop-down menu to:
    * select household (#29) - clicking it will switch current user's context to the selected household and take 
    user to [Inventory page](#inventory-page)
    * edit household - clicking it will take user to [Household edit page](#household-edit-page) for selected household
    * add new household (#29) - clicking it will take user to [Household edit page](#household-edit-page) for new 
    household

![Top menu mockup](./documentation/mockups/img/TopMenu.png)

#### Navigation menu component
All pages except the [Default page](#default-page), [Household edit page](#household-edit-page) and 
[Account settings page](#account-settings-page) will display a navigation menu. It will show list of links/buttons 
to navigate to all available listings in the system:
* [Inventory](#inventory-page)
* [Shopping list](#shopping-list-page)
* [Items page](#items-page)
* Item categories
* Storages
* Storage types
* [Shopping list history](#shopping-list-history-page)
* UoMs

![Navigation menu mockup](./documentation/mockups/img/NavigationMenu.png)

#### Common list component
It is useful to prepare a common component that will display system entities and their interesting properties 
in a table. Each row should display information about a single entity and by clicking the row, it should display 
the detail component for the entity in a hover window.
The component will provide:
* table header - dynamically defined according to displayed entity. Filtering and sorting is not a part 
of the prototype, but the component should be extendable as this functionality will have a high priority 
in future releases
* Table of values - each entity name will open a [Common detail component](#common-detail-component) for the entity,
each line will have a "Remove" column on the last position to remove the entity
* Add button - on click it will display a Create hover window
* Internal scrolling (only the table values are scrolled), the header and add button should stay at the same position

__URL path__ - /<entity_name>

![Common list mockup](./documentation/mockups/img/CommonList.png)

#### Common detail component
Same as common listing, it will be useful to provide a generic component for displaying details about entities 
in the system. The component should be shown as a hover window over the listing and should display all properties 
of selected component.

In the addition it should show an "Edit" button that will switch the component to  Common edit component and 
a "Dismiss" button as a cross in top-right corner.

__URL path__ - /<entity_name>/<entity_id>

![Common detail mockup](./documentation/mockups/img/CommonDetail.png)

#### Common edit component
The same as [Common detail component](#common-detail-component) but all entity properties (including name but excluding
ID) are displayed as editable text inputs. It provides three buttons:
* __Save__ - will update the system entity to current state of the edit component
* __Reset__ - will reset all local changes to the values saved in the system
* __Delete__ - will remove the entity from the system

Create is the same component as edit but the entity ID is not filled yet.

__URL path__ - /<entity_name>/<entity_id> (stays the same as detail, edit should not be available for bookmarking)

![Common edit mockup](./documentation/mockups/img/CommonEdit.png)

#### Household edit page
Selecting the "Add new" option from [Top menu](#top-menu-cmponent)'s Household selection or clicking the icon next to
a name of any existing one will open a [Common edit component](#common-edit-component) for households. The only 
exception to other entity editors, the household editor is not shown as hover window but fills the whole page.

User stories covered: (#5, #6)

![Household edit mockup](./documentation/mockups/img/Household-Edit.png)

#### Account settings page
Selecting the "Account settings" option from [Top menu](#top-menu-cmponent)'s user name drop-down box will open 
a [Common edit component](#common-edit-component) for user. Same as household edit, the user edit is not shown as
hover window but fills the whole page.

This page by default provides possibility to change password.

![Account settings mockup](./documentation/mockups/img/AccountSettings.png)

#### Inventory page
Clicking the "Inventory" navigation button from [Navigation menu](#navigation-menu-component) will show 
[Common list component](#common-list-component) for storage items.

__URL path__ - /inventory

![Item lsiting mockup](./documentation/mockups/img/Inventory-Listing.png)
![Item detail mockup](./documentation/mockups/img/Inventory-Detail.png)
![Item edit mockup](./documentation/mockups/img/Inventory-Edit.png)

#### Items page
Clicking the "Items" navigation button from [Navigation menu](#navigation-menu-component) will show 
[Common list component](#common-list-component) for items. This page should serve as an example for all other 
list/edit/create pages in the system (because I'm lazy to do the same mockup again and again).

__URL path__ - /items

![Item lsiting mockup](./documentation/mockups/img/ItemsPage-Listing.png)
![Item detail mockup](./documentation/mockups/img/ItemsPage-Detail.png)
![Item edit mockup](./documentation/mockups/img/ItemsPage-Edit_Create.png)

#### Shopping list page
Clicking the "Shopping List" navigation button from [Navigation menu](#navigation-menu-component) will show 
Shopping list page. This page will show  the date and when the shopping list was open and list of entered items, their
amounts, UoMs and a check box to mark the item as checked.
Whenever an item is added to the list, new line for next item appears.
In the addition there is a button to purchase all items, close shopping list and move all unchecked items to the new 
shopping list.

__URL path__ - /shopping-list

![Shopping list mockup](./documentation/mockups/img/ShoppingList.png)

#### Shopping list history page
Shopping list history provides only listing of closed shopping lists and their details on row click, it has no
possibility to add and edit.

![Shopping list history listing mockup](./documentation/mockups/img/ShoppingListHistory-Listing.png)
![Shopping list history detail mockup](./documentation/mockups/img/ShoppingListHistory-Detail.png)

### Backend

#### Database
__TODO__: rework data model according to current implementation
To provide real data separation for households, each household should have its own DB schema. In the addition the 
"Master data" schema needs to be present to store data that need to be accessed globally - for the prototype 
the Master data schema should contain just Users and Households. All other data are stored in household schemas.

Data model should be defined on Java level as JPA entities, the DDL for prototype should be generated fully by
JPA framework. TODO: find the best JEE world alternative for Spring Data JPA.
![Data model diagram](./documentation/diagrams/img/HomeManagerDataModel.png)

#### Common CRUD service
As the entities managed by the system are very similar in many aspects, a common service to provide basic CRUD 
operations will help to speed up the development. Especially when there is
[such common component](#common-list-component) present in frontend. An abstract Entity class should be created that 
contains following field:
* __id: String__ - ID of the entity, for future extensibility, use String UUIDs for all IDs in the system.

The service should provide following methods:
* __create entity__ - this method will create new entity in the system based on input object, it will create and assign 
new ID to the entity
* __find entity by ID__ - this method will return the entity identified by given ID
* __list entities__ - this method will list all the entities in the system, it should be parametrized to allow filtering 
and ordering
* __update entity__ - this method will update the entity in the system according to the given object - the existing
 entity is fully overwritten with the given one
* __delete entity by ID__ - this method will delete the entity identified by given ID

#### User service
Special implementation of [Common CRUD service](#common-crud-service) focused on master data entity User. Its main 
entity is User class, descendant of Entity class with following additional fields:
* __givenName: String__ - First name of the user
* __surname: String__ - Last name of the user
* __email: String__ - Email address of the user
* __password: String__ - User's current password (TODO: think about best way to store it)
* __laguage: String__ - Preffered language of the user

Additional methods:
* __authenticate user__ - (#4) this method will check combination of email address and password to determine whether 
the user exists in the system and whether the password matches the stored value, it will return the User object 
if successful, throw AuthenticationException otherwise.
* __is user online__ - (#9) this method will check whether the given user is currently online

![User service diagram](./documentation/diagrams/img/UserService.png)

#### Household service
Special implementation of [Common CRUD service](#common-crud-service) focused on master data entity Household. Its main
entity is Household class, descendant of Entity class with following additional fields:

users to create households with same names as other users.
* __schemaName: String__ - name of the database schema where the household data are stored
* __schemaPassword: String__ - password to the database schema of the household (TODO: think about the best way 
to store it and whether it is really a good approach to to store the information here (maybe an automatically managed 
Datasource object provided by application server is better?))

Additional methods:
* __get households for user__ - this method will return list of all households that given user is member of

![Household service diagram](./documentation/diagrams/img/HouseholdService.png)

default items and fill it to each household? make item a master data entity?)
* __description: String__ - Description of the item (TODO: think of localization the same way as for name)
* __category: Category__ - Category that the item is assigned to

set of default item categories and fill it to each household? make item category a master data entity?)
* __description: String__ - Description of the item category (TODO: think of localization the same way as for name)

![Item category service diagram](./documentation/diagrams/img/ItemCategoryService.png)

#### UoM Service
Special implementation of [Common CRUD service](#common-crud-service) focused on household data entity UoM. Its main
entity is UoM class, descendant of Entity class with following additional fields:

of default items and fill it to each household? make item a master data entity?)
* __abbreviation: String__ - common abbreviation of the unit (TODO: think of localization the same way as for name)
* __base: UoM__ - base unit for current unit or null if it's a base unit itself
* __ratioToBase: double__ - ratio to convert the unit to the base unit, or null if it's a base unit itself

Additional methods:
* __convert amount__ - this method converts given amount from one unit to another, only works for units that share 
the same base unit, otherwise an IllegalArgumentException is thrown

![UoM service diagram](./documentation/diagrams/img/UoMService.png)
